To get this running, you need to:

1. Prepare a MYSQL database using the scripts provided;


2. Install node modules both for 'frontend' and 'backend' folder:

```
npm install
```

3. For 'backend' folder, you also need:
```
npm install mysql2
```

4. Open terminal in 'backend' folder and type:
```
npm run server
```

5. Open terminal in 'frontend' folder and type:
```
npm run start
```

6. Visit the page via http://localhost:3000/

My node.js version: v14.19.3

My npm version: 6.14.16
